"""Sits between controller_server's raw cmd_vel output and Gazebo, forcing
the sim vehicle to match the REAL buggy's actual command contract instead
of TEB's freely-optimized velocity profile.

Confirmed from the real UART protocol (old workspace, uart_sender_node.py /
uart_interface.py): the real hardware does NOT accept a commanded speed at
all - the 6-byte packet is START, yellow, red, degree(16-bit), END. Only
steering angle and a stop/caution flag pair are sent; speed is fixed in
the vehicle itself, not software-controlled. TEB's own max_vel_x (up to
2.5 m/s / 9 km/h, tuned for a vehicle that doesn't exist) and its
continuously-varying speed-for-cornering behavior have no real-hardware
equivalent - simply capping max_vel_x lower would still leave TEB free to
slow down for turns, which the real buggy can't do. This node instead
overwrites the commanded speed's MAGNITUDE outright: exactly
target_speed_ms when TEB commands any meaningful forward motion, exactly
0 when TEB's own linear.x drops below min_forward_speed (same "stopped"
threshold and reasoning as steering_uart_bridge.py's final_red_detected
in the old workspace).

Steering is NOT simply passed through unchanged, either: TEB computed its
angular.z assuming ITS OWN chosen speed, not the fixed speed this node
then substitutes. Overwriting linear.x alone while keeping the old
angular.z would silently change the actual curvature Gazebo executes
(same angular.z at a different linear.x is a different turning radius).
Recovering the intended STEERING ANGLE first (same atan2 formula
steering_uart_bridge.py uses) and then re-deriving angular.z for the new
fixed speed keeps the executed curvature matching what TEB actually
planned, not an accidental side effect of the speed override.

IMPORTANT: the atan2 recovery uses target_speed_ms (this node's fixed
output speed) as the denominator, NOT msg.linear.x (TEB's own transient
commanded speed). TEB regularly commands a small linear.x while
cornering (its own free-speed optimization slowing down for the turn) -
with that small value in atan2's denominator, a perfectly ordinary bend
recovers as a near-maximum steering angle (confirmed live: ~20deg
commands for slight turns). Since the real vehicle only ever actually
moves at target_speed_ms (never at whatever transient speed TEB
privately assumed), that is the speed the steering angle must be solved
for for the recovered curvature to mean anything physically - this also
matches controller_server's own max_vel_x now being pinned to
target_speed_ms in this launch, so TEB itself no longer has room to plan
a freely-variable speed profile to begin with.

Output steering is additionally slew-rate limited (max_steering_rate_deg_s,
default 30 deg/s) - even a legitimate sharp curvature change (new carrot
point, a replan) ramps in over successive cycles instead of jumping
instantly, since no real steering actuator can snap either.

Also publishes a live TEXT_VIEW_FACING telemetry marker above the vehicle
- target distance (to the current plan's final waypoint), speed, and
steering angle - the same three-field format ground_segmentation/
steering_calculator_node.py and local_nav/steering_uart_bridge.py both
used in the old workspace ("Command: X deg | Speed: Y km/h"), extended
with target distance since carrot_path_publisher already computes exactly
that. A fourth line ("Feedback: ...") is intentionally left for later:
once a real UART bridge exists in this workspace, the ACTUAL steering
angle decoded from hardware feedback (not just what was commanded) goes
here - matching uart_bridge.py's own feedback decode in the old codebase,
which this node cannot show yet since nothing in this workspace talks to
real UART hardware.
